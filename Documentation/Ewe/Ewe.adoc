= Ewe product imports

== If we want to import Ewe products we need to do next:
1. Start app swagger
2. Import E-mall excell file which contains SKU and classifications and prices
3. We will fetch Ewe url to retrieve all products but we can't download image directly from url
4. Behind the scene we will download images into configured local directory
5. Copy images to FTP server under /var/import/images/ewe directory
6. Import generated CSV file and specify "Images File Directory" to be "ewe"
